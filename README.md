Author - Lucas Matheson

Description - This game is a final project for Discrete Math (COS 280). The goal is for an artifical intellegence model to learn to 
navigate the track and find the quickest way to win. This will be attempted by multple different algorithms, these are to be tested. 

This branch will contian the deep learning model, drafts, and any script associated with deep learning.
