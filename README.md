# First-Racing-Game
Author - Lucas Matheson

Description - This game is a final project for Discrete Math (COS 280). There are multiple goals with this project.
The first one is to explore deep learning models, along with the mathematics behind them. With this model, I look for it to learn to 
navigate the track and find the quickest way to win. This will be attempted by multple different algorithms. (These are to be tested). 

My second goal is to expand my current understanding of the C# language. Unity scripts run off of C#, a language I look to learn and use in my 
career. This project allows me to expand my current understanding of C#. 

Currently, the game contains an AI model that can either traverse a directed graph (Located in hidden nodes around the track) or chase the player. 

Once this project is complete, it is looked to be expanded on as a personal project to be a full game

Here is a current demo of the game. It contains a red car and a blue car. The blue car is the AI model, following four nodes located at each corner of the track.
The red car is a user player, which is me in this case.

## Here is the final product, a greedy algorithm that will always choose the shortest path
