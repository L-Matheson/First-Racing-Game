# First-Racing-Game
Author - Lucas Matheson

Description - This game is a final project for Discrete Math (COS 280). The goal is for an artificial intelligence model to learn to 
navigate the track and find the quickest way to win. This will be attempted by multple different algorithms. (These are to be tested). 

Currently, the game contains an AI model that can either traverse a directed graph (Located in hidden nodes around the track) or chase the player. 

Once this project is complete, it is looked to be expanded on as a personal project to be a full game
